## Honest Assessment

This is coursework, not original research. I'm including it because it demonstrates fundamental data analysis skills, but my more recent projects (see [KKBOX Churn Prediction](https://github.com/robertlupo1997/KKBOX-Music-Churn-Prediction)) better represent my current capabilities.
